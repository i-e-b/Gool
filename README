Phantom 2 is a lexer/parser for C#

TODO
====

- [ ] Replace scanner+offset with a list of matches-so-far
- [ ] Roll in a full set of real-world tests
- [ ] Proper AST output (including failures -- give furthest AST)

- [ ] Provide a good normal fluent interface as well as BNFish one
- [ ] Binary and unary parsers that can have associativity and priority
- [ ] Grouping parser that applies a shunting-yard infix-to-(?post/pre)fix manipulation
     * Then associativity & precedence to rearrange AST.
 
Demos
=====
 - Use Pascal parser to make a simple interpreter
 - XML parser
 - JSON parser
