Phantom 2 is a lexer-less parser for C#

TODO
====
 - Roll in a full set of unit tests
 - Proper AST output (including failures -- give furthest AST)

 - Provide a good normal fluent interface as well as BNFish one
 - Binary and uniary parsers that can have associativiy and priority
 - Grouping parser that applies a shunting-yard infix-to-(?post/pre)fix manipulation
     * Then associativity & precedence to rearrange AST.
 
Demos
=====
 - Finish Pascal parser, make a simple interpreter
 - XML parser
 - JSON parser
