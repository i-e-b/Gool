TODO
====
 - Roll in a full set of unit tests
 - Provide a good normal fluent interface as well as BNFish one
 - Binary and uniary parsers that can have associativiy and priority
 - Grouping parser that applies a shunting-yard infix-to-(?post/pre)fix manipulation
     * Then associativity & precedence to rearrange AST.
 - Remove semantic action crap
 - Proper AST output
 
Demos
=====
